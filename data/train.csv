The basic thought is to re-organise the relationship between

expanded technologically; the starting point however remains
set in “real space”.A portable screen is used to visualise the soundsculpture; a
camera attached to the screen collects information of the space
surrounding it from markers distributed on adjacent surfaces.
The screen becomes a transmitter superimposing a digital layer
-the sculpture onto “real space” (the unmanipulated space that
greets the naked eye). The process allows the viewer to abandon
the passive position of the “merely on-looking” consumer; he is
enabled to visually and acoustically intervene with the sculpture,
to model and module it. His changing positions and movements
affect the visualisations on the screen, rendering an “extended
reality” accessible. The sculpture generated is individually linked

This highly organic pictorial frame spawns a contemporary form of moving abstract paintings or associative drawings. The volumetric fountain, the pond reflections and iridescent flares shape a plasmatic spatial system, which is extended by a secondary video projection. This additional layer illuminates the surrounding area, integrating vegetation and the passing visitors into an abstracted mirage-stage.

Here, twining lines change their density within the evolving volume as fragile light patterns float in the bank of fog.

Benjy initially approached me to produce a 5 second proposal sequence (for my convenience), as he knew I'd be doing this between commercial work, but I felt 5 seconds wouldn't justify or convey enough the significance of what he was about to do. I added an extra 15 seconds to give the short a little more narrative & emotion.

His brief was to create something with a classic hollywood romance musical-type feel. He also specifically requested a look inspired by Disney's award winning short, ""Paperman"", as his fiance (Victoria) really loved the film... Needless to say, I couldn't produce anything to that standard on my own & with the little time I had, but here's what I came up with in roughly 3 days. He proposed by hiring a cinema screen, where they watched a 14 minute film he made for her, & at the end of that film came this little short... The rest is now history.

Process-wise, I worked the timing & the rough animation in Flash (CS3), the cleanup in Photoshop (CS5) & the finish in After Effects for the diffusion & film grain.

Transporting this beauty to a virtual realm, Quayola’s sculptures are accompanied by a multi-channel video installation. In the process of creating “Captives”, he used mathematical functions to describe endlessly evolving geological formations, which morph into classical figures. Pure geometric abstraction takes over as he reframes his subjects using a computational method of triangulation, leaving the final work “unfinished”.

As in previous projects, Quayola crafts a peculiar distance from his subjects, and wanders through the surface of an object, pushing beyond its picture plane. Informed by his experiences growing up in Rome, and spiritually detaching from the city's rich tradition in architecture, the work is rooted in geometry and the iconography of perfection. Evoking the unexpected allure of a Chinese scholar’s stone, textural details in the surface of Quayola’s “Captives” result from an industrial milling technique.",,,

Holding the door for someone, recommending a book, letting someone ahead of you in line- these are little things that people do for each other.

Bombas created an online campaign that allowed users to submit deeds to inspire people this holiday season. We created a moving physical sculpture that brought this campaign to life.

The Good Deed Machine lived in the window of the Gap store at 54th and 5th for 2 weeks. Passers by could place their hand on the glass and watch the gears and pistons of the machine startup. The activity of the machine would then produce a good deed, written by online users, for them to carry out this Holiday. The end result was a playful and kinetic way to visualize the flow of goodwill during the Holidays.

The inspiration came from playing around with the Clouds Parasites 1.3 alternate firmware running in the Resonator mode highlighting the ""scatter"" (or strum) function. The master clock was the Tiptop Circadian Rhythms module, taking the first 4 outputs into my Nord Drum 2 for the Kick, snare, closed and open hi-hats. From there the clock output from the CR was multiplied and then sent to the Modcan Touch Sequencer. First row output from the TS was sent to the intellijel Shapeshifter creating a two note baseline sequence that comes in at 1:58. The second sequence Row2 output from the TS was sent to the ""ALM Akemie's Castle"" module OSC A output using the chord function, that comes in at 25 seconds. The gates from the modcan where set to a 16th's pulse sequence. Modulation from the synthesis technology E102 Quad Temporal Shifter output 1 modulating the Multiplier input on Operator 1. The 2, 3 and 4 outputs from the E102 where also modulating the Operator 2, 3, and 4 inputs on the Akemie's Castle. This was creating the harmonic timbre changing as the sequence was playing.

The slowly evolving sweeping noise textures that come in at 1:09 is from the Music Thing Radio Music module. The sample was a white noise sampled lightly filtered and then sent to the intellijel HexVCA with the amplitude CV control via a Intellijel Dixie modulating from slow to high rates (free running). The Make Noise Rene was being externally clocked from the Circadian Rhythm, and was sending out a quantized output to the Mutable Instruments Clouds pitch input creating the chord guitar sequence. The strum sounds on Clouds was played by the 4ms QCD running in 32th division output into the Trigger input. The freeze input was also triggered by a Ladik R-110 Random clock module. The combination of the two created the trill chord like strums.

The bass guitar tone sound that comes in at 1:24 are from the MakeNoise Mysteron, that is being sequenced by the Modcan Touch Sequencer, Row Output 3 was programmed in the same key but a lower octave. The ""Rings"" module was creating slow attack soft high pitched chords in reverb that come around 2:50. There was additional processing of the Clouds output that was sent into the Tiptop ZDSP module running the ""Halls of Vahalla"" card program 8 ""Ginnungagap"" creating the high pitch octave deep reverb shimmer effects. The harmonic slow swells that come in at 3:30 where created using another intellijel Dixie oscillator sine output running into an Strymon ""Big Sky"" pedal being harmonically controlled by an intellijel µScale V1. The output was being played slowly then processed using the ""Choral"" mode, creating the slow shimmer swells. The entire mix was sent into the Eventide Space pedal using the ""Corridors"" patch.",,,

But it wasn’t always seen as that, and it still doesn’t act quite like other numbers. Can you divide by zero, for example?

I think that most of the entertainment`s world nowadays has become monstrous and it is no longer just eyes` illusion, but often illusion of the mind.
I do not know about you but personally, among all these innovation`s turbines, I find myself still attracted by ancient methods and tools which continue to fascinate me. Some time ago I came across a phenakistoscope (also spelled as phenakistiscope or phenakitiscope or phantasmascope or phantascope), an antique optical instrument that displays animated images (practically current animated gif) invented in 1832 by Joseph Plateau. I then found some scans of these circles on the Internet and I began to digitally animate them. After a few attempts, I started to combine these animations trying to create something original and unpublished. Eventually, in order to stay on, I created a stop motion with paper toys from nineteenth-century that open and close the video. The music was carefully crafted by Al-Maranca.
The result of all this work is called ""L'illusion de Joseph"" in honour of Joseph Plateau, inventor of phenakistoscope.",,,

I grew up in the island city-state of Singapore, where encounters with migrants of countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Myanmar, China and the Philippines are part of everyday living. Many of them take on jobs that are considered by the larger public to be menial in nature. Sometimes, the differences in our cultures and socioeconomic statuses cause social friction. When we allow this to be left unchecked, it can evolve into darker displays of xenophobic behavior.
But the inability to see past differences is not just a local issue; it is an increasingly global one. From where I am now in the United States, I am beginning to see how irresponsible political rhetoric, among other factors, influences previously big-hearted populations, populations which embraced – indeed championed – diversity.
My response to this wave of sentiments is inspired by a quote I came across recently, attributed to the French composer Claude Debussy: music is the silence between the notes. The project aims to recognize the silent migrant workers’ contributions to our communities and celebrate their music between our notes.
“My Brother” is thus a metaphor for the thousands of underappreciated migrant workers we come across during our daily commute. I believe that bridges are built on bricks of commonalities and so the focus of this project is on the spaces of our shared humanity – school, families and personal dreams.",,,
